== Overview

One of the problems Iâ€™ve had for a while now is figuring out what stack to use for my testing, both for my back end code (unit & integration) as well as my front end code (unit & integration).  So I set about on a journey in April 2011 to find the best full stack integration components for a Rails project and document it for others to use.

This source code library is composed of a simple Calculator application which has both back end and front end functionality and code.  The calculator has full stack integration and unit testing for both the back end and front end.
